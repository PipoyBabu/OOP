This Multi-Level Parking Management System is a Java command-line application that helps manage vehicle registrations, allocate parking slots across multiple floors, and handle parking transactions. It supports cars, motorcycles, and electric vehicles while enforcing height and PWD rules, and it stores parked-state and receipts in text files so data survives restarts. Operators use simple menus to register vehicles, park them, compute fees, process payments, and export or restore the parking state. The project separates billing, storage, and slot-allocation logic to keep the code modular, readable, and easier to maintain. As a sophomore IT student, I used this app to practice file-based persistence, menu-driven interfaces, and basic object-oriented design for a real-world problem.
